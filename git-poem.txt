git oh git,
oh how you commit
to your log; you don't quit.
you remember the why,
the what, the who,
of things that we do.

is there anything
that you cannot do?

git oh git,
oh faithful git.
you see how i change

with a push and a pull
we share and we pool
our work for the merge
the merge. the merge.

today is git's 12th birthday!
happy birthday!
